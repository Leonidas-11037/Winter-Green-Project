        <section class="inner1">
            <p>In my efforts to pursue a landscape worth documenting, I’ve reached into the depths of my memory before rediscovering a place I admired for its beauty. Housing a forest of trees that guide towards a view of a treacherous ravine.</p>
            <img src="images/IMG_0085.JPG" />
            <p class="mono">One of multiple entrances to the outlook. This was arguably the one who's entrance is closest to the scenic outlook. Be sure to follow the rules. Or else...</p>
            <p>One of the entrances is located behind Trippe Hall. A dedicated path was cleared to make the journey within the area easy enough to not trip or get caught on something. This area is maintained, but not heavily modified. Just don't do anything irrational and help keep it this way if you plan to visit.</p>
            <img src="images/IMG_0042.JPG" />
            <p class="mono">A view of the forest aspect of the gorge view area. Trees grow from the floor of leaves as stumps and logs remind us what came before. The path to the outlook can stretch and split along the land.</p>
        <h2>An Elevated Entrance</h2>

            <img src="images/IMG_0099.JPG" />
            <p class="mono">Two different shots of two scenes near the outlook. The lighting can vary thanks to the towering trees blocking the sun. Not quite the main attraction, but gorgeous in its own right.</p>
            <p>These areas are right before the Wintergreen Gorge Scenic Overlook behind Trippe Hall at Penn State Behrend. Coordinates for two of these shots were, “42.114282, -79.987225” and “42.1138417, -79.9871055”. These views are seen at the beginning of the trek into what gave this area its name. The pathway to the gorge is a dense one for those who stay on the trail. The landscape subtly shifting as you head deeper along the trail. This Pennsylvania expedition will bring you to a sight spanning the rushing waters to the sky itself.</p>
            <img src="images/IMG_0041.JPG" />
            <p class="mono">The overlook is just up ahead. It's easy to tell when you're close.</p>

        <h2>The Gorge Scenic Outlook</h2>
            <p>A treacherous road lies straight left from that point. A clearer view of the gorge is to the left, showing more of the river, one of man’s contributions to the landscape, and a better idea of how dangerous a drop from this height would be. To the left, a land that still takes a halfpipe shape that bends as it moves along. There are no major bodies of water at the bottom of this land, but the land itself seems to rise higher the further along it goes.</p>

    <h2>Between Two Fields</h2>
    <p>A treacherous road lies straight left from that point. A clearer view of the gorge is to the left, showing more of the river, one of man’s contributions to the landscape, and a better idea of how dangerous a drop from this height would be. To the left, a land that still takes a halfpipe shape that bends as it moves along. There are no major bodies of water at the bottom of that land, but the land itself seems to rise higher the further along it goes.</p>
    <img src="images/IMG_0135.JPG" />
    <p class="mono">The entrance to this area is to the right of the original outlook. Be warned that there is no safety measures anywhere here. Just as nature intended</p>
    <img src="images/IMG_0074.JPG" />
    <p class="mono">The more known left outlook </p>
    <img src="images/IMG_0146.JPG" />
    <p class="mono">The right outlook. As it can be seen, a powerline goes through this area from one side to the other</p>

        <section class="inner1">
            <h2>Fourmile Creek: Bottom of the Gorge</h2>
            <p>There is more than one entrance to the gorge as a whole. You won't be elevated as the trail leads downward towards Fourmile Creek, the waters that could be seen earlier from the overlook.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I believe this landscape of Wintergreen is well maintained due to the cut down remains staying in the area to be used by the ecosystem, thus having the process of self-renewal occur naturally. For an area near a collage residence hall, it is important to maintain the health of this area and not to tamper with it too much. It showcases outcome of preserving land that went maintained by efforts to keep the land healthy. It’s layered and has a long way down. It has variety in the scenes to be captured. Overall, the view from Wintergreen Gorge is beautiful with the sense of height and the layered land.  It’s near a residence hall that many call home, so it must be respected like how one tends to a backyard garden, except significantly more dangerous with the lack of railings.</p>
