        <section class="inner1">
            <p>In my efforts to pursue a landscape worth documenting, I’ve reached into the depths of my memory before rediscovering a place I admired for its beauty. Housing a forest of trees that guide towards a view of a treacherous ravine.</p>
            <p>Sample</p>
        <h2>An Elevated Entrance</h2>
            <p>This area is right before the Wintergreen Gorge Scenic Overlook behind Trippe Hall at Penn State Behrend. Coordinates for two of these shots were, “42.114282, -79.987225” and “42.1138417, -79.9871055”. These views are seen at the beginning of the trek into what gave this area its name. The pathway to the gorge is a dense one for those who stay on the trail. The landscape subtly shifting as you head deeper along the trail. This Pennsylvania expedition will bring you to a sight spanning the rushing waters to the sky itself.</p>

        <section class="inner1">
        <h2>The Gorge Scenic Outlook</h2>
            <p>A treacherous road lies straight left from that point. A clearer view of the gorge is to the left, showing more of the river, one of man’s contributions to the landscape, and a better idea of how dangerous a drop from this height would be. To the left, a land that still takes a halfpipe shape that bends as it moves along. There are no major bodies of water at the bottom of this land, but the land itself seems to rise higher the further along it goes.</p>

            <p></p>
        </section>
        <section class="inner1">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I believe this landscape of Wintergreen is well maintained due to the cut down remains staying in the area to be used by the ecosystem, thus having the process of self-renewal occur naturally. For an area near a collage residence hall, it is important to maintain the health of this area and not to tamper with it too much. It showcases outcome of preserving land that went maintained by efforts to keep the land healthy. It’s layered and has a long way down. It has variety in the scenes to be captured. Overall, the view from Wintergreen Gorge is beautiful with the sense of height and the layered land.  It’s near a residence hall that many call home, so it must be respected like how one tends to a backyard garden, except significantly more dangerous with the lack of railings.</p>
